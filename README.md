Luxury Bookings
-------------------------
Create a Booking platform web application wherein user can book a room for a specific date range and required no. of person. 

I created a web application that focuses on back-end using C#. I have used ASP.Net MVC as a architectural pattern because I have 5 years experience developing with this kind of pattern and also its easy to maintain. 

If given a chance to develop it for a much longer time I would like to add a calendar feature that highlighted all the vacant dates so that user can already see the available dates of the room and also I would like to add a filter for rooms by price or capacity.
